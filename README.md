# Load Balancer
Load balancer for efficient dispatching and scheduling of blockchain rpc API web requests.


#### NodeJs Load Balancer Server
A ***NodeJs*** load balancer server is designed specifically for blockchain rpc API web requests, offering efficient dispatching and scheduling of requests to multiple backend servers. It intelligently distributes requests based on server health, resource utilization, and other factors, preventing bottlenecks and ensuring smooth processing. With fault tolerance, scalability, and dynamic resource management, this load balancer optimizes the performance and reliability of blockchain applications.

#### React Load Balancer App
Real-time app written in ***ReactJs + TypeScript*** for real-time monitoring and controling the backend servers.
It includes monitoring the next resources for every node:
  - Server real-time requests number
  - Max requests number for every node independently
  - Active status with possibility of activation and deactivation the server
  - Servers health status and performance
  - Alive status
